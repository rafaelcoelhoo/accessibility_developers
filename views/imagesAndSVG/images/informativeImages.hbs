    <p>Note: Please note that while ARIA can be used as a solution in certain cases, it is always preferable to prioritize the use of native HTML elements whenever possible. Native HTML provides built-in accessibility features and semantic meaning, ensuring better accessibility without relying heavily on ARIA attributes</p>
